# An answer repository for K&R's ANSI-C:

Beyond simply loving C, there's no real point to this repository. It's written by a self-taught 
programmer who can't get a job within the tech industry, and has no real credentials to his name.
Every other remote repo on my GitHub is utterly worthless code but, this one could potentially be
of use to anyone who's currently learning the C programming language via K&R's book.

I don't work for a big tech company... or, any sized tech company for that matter. But I do have
a very physically demanding job within the service industry; and thus, progress on solving the
exercises shall be incredibly slow.

All exercises shall be solved by me as correctly and exactly as possible. Whenever I make a
perceived improvement to the solution asked for, or go beyond the scope of what was required I'll
be sure to let you know.

## The Book
"The (ANSI) C Programming language" is in my opinion, the one true Holy Bible for writing C. It's
so well written, that I've been struggling to make it past the 2nd chapter because I can't refrain
from re-reading it. So if you've picked it up to learn programming, then you've made a decision
that can only be described as based! And I hope this repo helps 🥹
